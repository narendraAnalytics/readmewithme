Below is the **exact, minimal, copy-paste–safe code setup** to **create and install an Expo Dev Client** for your **ReadWithMe** project.
Follow in order. Do not skip steps.

---

## 1️⃣ Install required Expo Dev Client packages

From your **ReadWithMe project root**:

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

(This ensures native support for deep links + OAuth.)

---

## 2️⃣ Set the app scheme (CRITICAL)

### `app.json` or `app.config.js`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "ReadWithMe",
    "slug": "readwithme",
    "scheme": "readwithme",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.readwithme.app"
    }
  }
}
```

This enables:

```
readwithme://oauth-native-callback
```

⚠️ The `scheme` **must exactly match** what you added in Clerk.

---

## 3️⃣ Login to Expo (once)

```bash
npx expo login
```

---

## 4️⃣ Create the Expo Dev Client build (Android – recommended)

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

OR (cloud build – easiest, no Android Studio needed):

```bash
npx expo prebuild
npx expo build:android -t development
```

👉 **Use this if you don’t want Android Studio locally**

---

## 5️⃣ Install the Dev Client on your phone

After the build finishes:

* Expo shows a **QR code**
* Open it on your phone
* Install **ReadWithMe** (APK)

You will now see:

* ❌ Expo Go (ignore)
* ✅ ReadWithMe (Dev Client)

---

## 6️⃣ Start the app (Dev Client mode)

Run:

```bash
npx expo start --dev-client
```

Then:

* Open **ReadWithMe** on your phone
* App connects to Metro
* Live reload works

---

## 7️⃣ Verify Google OAuth now works

Click:

> Continue with Google

Expected flow:

```
ReadWithMe → Google → Clerk → readwithme://oauth-native-callback → ReadWithMe
```

✅ Redirect works
✅ User logged in
✅ Issue resolved

---

## 🔍 Common mistakes (avoid these)

* ❌ Opening Expo Go instead of ReadWithMe
* ❌ Missing `scheme`
* ❌ Scheme mismatch in Clerk
* ❌ Testing OAuth before Dev Client install

---

## ✅ Final confirmation checklist

✔ `expo-dev-client` installed
✔ `scheme: "readwithme"` added
✔ Dev Client installed on phone
✔ Running with `--dev-client`
✔ Testing inside **ReadWithMe app**

---

### One-line takeaway

> **Google login will NOT work until you run your app inside an Expo Dev Client — and now you have the exact code to do it.**
